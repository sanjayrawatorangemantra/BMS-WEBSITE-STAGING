                    <p class="lead1">
                    At BeatMySugar, we believe there is a better way to approach diabetic management. We believe in delivering value, and the real value comes only when we start putting the spotlight on what matters. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead1">
                    What has been long approached as merely a state of improper glucose metabolism goes far beyond that. Diabetes management currently calls for a huge paradigm shift as to how diabetes is perceived and managed. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead1">
                    The much prevalent and dominant model of treatment needs to be replaced, and this is where we come into the picture. 
                    </p>
                    <ul class="lead1">
                      <li>
                      To inform you that diabetes is a tricky and complex condition, the management goes much beyond glycaemic control.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      	To make you aware of the fact that this multifaceted condition needs a multidimensional approach to management, which amalgamates the three aspects i.e., awareness, lifestyle adaptations, and medicinal care.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                      And finally, to offer you one integrated and connected platform named BeatMySugar that blends medical, lifestyle, behavioural, and emotional help in an attempt to facilitate your navigation through the various life stages of your pre-diabetic and diabetic health.

                    Shaurya is an energetic millennial who has been battling diabetes for years now. He was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when he was just 10 years old. For him, it was highly challenging to control the severe cravings for food, especially the junk, at such a tender age. However, the experience of diabetes has moulded him to respect his body and take care of himself in a manner he thought would not have possible otherwise. He is a final year graduate student at the University of Delhi.

                      counselor and educator, he works closely
                      with newly diagnosed kids and their

                      to the change in his life very soon. But
                      life came to a stand still for him and his
                      family when his younger son Aarush was
                      diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in Dec
                      2016. He had never met a Type 1 Diabetic
                      all his life till that time, gradually he
                      started meeting Type 1 Diabetics and
                      slowly yet steadily they were able to
                      build a strong community of Type 1
                      Diabetics and that is how DIYA was formed.
